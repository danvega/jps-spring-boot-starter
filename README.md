# JsonPlaceholder Service Spring Boot Starter

This is a Spring Boot Starter for the [JsonPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) service. I use this service all the time and decided to create a Spring Boot Starter for it. 


## Getting Started


```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>dev.danvega</groupId>
    <artifactId>jps-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

## What's next 

I plan on adding more features to this starter in the future to support all of the JsonPlaceholder endpoints.
